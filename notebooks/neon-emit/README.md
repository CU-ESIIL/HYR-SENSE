## Notebooks for working with NEON and EMIT Hyperspectral Data

These notebooks were modified from the [NASA VITALS repository](https://github.com/nasa/VITALS), but demonstrate how to download and work with NEON AOP (National Ecological Observatory Network Airborne Observation Platform) and EMIT data instead of ECOSTRESS and EMIT data.

They demonstrate how to find spatially concurrent [NEON Directional Surface Reflectance Data](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30006.001) and EMIT data at the Niwot Ridge site, where HYR-SENSE participants will go for the 4th day of the workshop. 

[Setup instructions](https://github.com/bridgethass/VITALS/blob/main/setup/setup_instructions.md) are the same as for the VITALS repo. These notebooks should work with the HYR-SENSE workshop environment.
