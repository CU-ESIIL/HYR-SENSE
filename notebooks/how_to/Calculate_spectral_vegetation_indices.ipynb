    "### Step 3: Calculate spectral vegetation indices (SVIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will walk through how you calculate SVIs remote sensing data, and EMIT hyperspectral imagery in general, why you might select specific band combinations based on what you are studying, and a few different ways you can calculate SVIs using EMIT data, either in-line, defining functions, or using pre-built functions found in the provided [spectral_index.py](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/HYR-SENSE/blob/main/tools/functions/spectral_index.py) file\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's take a moment to consider again what remote sensing imagery like those provided by EMIT can tell us about the underlying vegetation. The internal structure and biochemistry of leaves (A) within a canopy control the optical signatures observed by remote sensing instrumentation (B). The amount of incident radiation that is reflected by, transmitted through, or absorbed by leaves within a canopy is regulated by these structural and biochemical properties of leaves. For example, leaf properties such as a thick cuticle layer, high wax, and/or a large amount of leaf hairs can significantly influence the amount of first-surface reflectance (that is the reflected light directly off the outer leaf layer that does not interact with the leaf interior), causing less solar radiation to penetrate into the leaf. The thickness of the mesophyll layer associated with other properties, such as thicker leaves, can cause higher degree of internal leaf scattering, less transmittance through the leaf, and higher absorption in some wavelengths. Importantly, the diffuse reflectance out of the leaf is that modified by internal leaf properties and contains useful for mapping functional traits (B). High spectral resolution measurements of leaves and plant canopies enable the indirect, non-contact measurement of key structural and chemical absorption features that are associated with the physiological and biochemical properties of plants (B)\n"
