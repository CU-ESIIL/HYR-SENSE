# Sharing Materials from Science Events
The movement toward open-source science requires a culture shift to make science more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative at all stages of the scientific process, including scientific conferences, workshops, and symposia. This page contains supplemental guidance for researchers to support the implementation of requirements for sharing scientific publications produced for science events established by SPD-41a. In the future, this guidance will be expanded to include additional recommendations for event organizers on making SMD-funded science events more inclusive, accessible, and open.

## Requirements 
Under SPD-41a, participants sponsored with SMD funding to attend conferences, workshops, or symposia shall deposit scientific publications produced for the event in an appropriate NASA designated repository. This includes conference proceedings, slide decks, poster presentations, and any other publications produced for the event.
This requirement does not apply to restricted information, nor does it apply to laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers or preprints, plans for future research, peer review reports, or communications with colleagues. 

## How to Share Publications Produced for an Event
A specific repository may be identified by a SMD solicitation. If no repository is specified, event participants have several options for sharing their scientific publications produced for SMD-funded events. These include:
* Submitting to [NASA STI Repository](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/). For those with a NASA identity who have completed the STRIVES process for their scientific publications produced for an event, these publications will be archived in the STI Repository and no additional action is required by the researcher.
* Sharing through an external, community-accepted repository (e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)). This option is recommended for those without a NASA identity.
