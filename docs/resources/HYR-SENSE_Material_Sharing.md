# HYR-SENSE Policy for Material Sharing

## NASA Instructions for Sharing Materials from Science Events
The movement toward open-source science requires a culture shift to make science more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative at all stages of the scientific process, including scientific conferences, workshops, and symposia. This page contains supplemental guidance for researchers to support the implementation of requirements for sharing scientific publications produced for science events established by NASA SPD-41a, which still doesn't include specific recommendations for event organizers. The SPD-41 "Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate" provides guidance on the open sharing of publications, data, and software created in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. SPD-41a builds upon the core principles of openness, equity, and security for SMD-funded research.    

According to SPD-41a, publicly available, SMD-funded data shall be made available without fee or restriction of use. The data shall be shared in a repository that provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to datasets and their metadata free of charge in a timely manner after submission, consistent with legal and policy requirements related to maintaining privacy and confidentiality, Tribal and national data sovereignty, and protection of sensitive data.

## HYR-SENSE Requirements 
Participants sponsored by NASA funding to attend the HYR-SENSE workshop must deposit scientific publications created for this and other events in its repository: https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/HYR-SENSE. This includes conference proceedings, slide decks, poster presentations, and other publications produced for an event with HYR-SENSE content. However, this requirement does not apply to restricted information, laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers or preprints, plans for future research, peer review reports, or communications with colleagues. Nonetheless, all HYR-SENSE notebooks, slide decks, publications, and reports produced by the team and participants shall be available to the public at the HYR-SENSE repository.

**HYR-SENSE** promotes co-production and embraces the values of ESIIL and the NASA HYR-SENSE team. We value diverse perspectives, create safe and inclusive spaces, and conduct **ethic open science** guided by the **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) [1] and **CARE** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) [2] principles for scientific and Indigenous data management, governance, and stewardship. **We respect data sovereignty and the protection of Indigenous data**, ensuring that data owners have the right to decide whether to share or protect their datasets.

## How to Share Publications Produced for an Event
Publication and other materials produced for and from HYR-SENSE should be deposited at the HYR-SENSE repository: https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/HYR-SENSE. In addition, event participants have several options for sharing their scientific publications produced for SMD-funded events. These include:
* Submitting to [NASA STI Repository](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/). For those with a NASA identity who have completed the STRIVES process for their scientific publications produced for an event, these publications will be archived in the STI Repository and no additional action is required by the researcher.
* Sharing through an external, community-accepted repository (e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)). This option is recommended for those without a NASA identity.
