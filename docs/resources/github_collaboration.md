## Some common git/GitHub problems you may encounter

During today's activities, we will also touch on the following common git/GitHub snafus, and how to fix them:

  - Triple check everything: the add-commit-push workflow
    - Add before you commit
    - Writing descriptive commit messages

  - Large files: ignore data files and clear outputs
  - How do you know it worked? Demystifying git status
  - Identifying and some basic approaches to merge conflicts
