This website has lots of information on things to do in Boulder, such as shopping, restaurants, nightlife, and much more! Weather and Packing \u00b6 Boulder is 5,430 feet in elevation and has a sunny, semi-arid climate. Hydrating during your stay is very important, as altitude sickness (headache, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness) can occur. Weather conditions can change rapidly throughout each day and from day to day. Layers are always a good choice. In summer months, average high daily temperatures are in the 80s and 90s, with lows in the 50s and 60s. The sun is strong in Boulder, so please bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. Afternoon thunderstorms aren\u2019t unusual, so a rain jacket is helpful. There are many trails near Boulder, so hiking or running shoes and a set of workout clothes can help get you outside during your stay.

The hotel provides a shuttle within a 5 mile radius between 8-4 pm, a daily hot breakfast buffet, and parking. The hotel is just steps from a shopping center with local dining options and a grocery store. Transportation \u00b6 Ground Transportation \u00b6 The HYR-SENSE Team is working on coordinating carpooling to and from the airport for those arriving around the same time. Ride Share A Lyft or Uber or airport taxi are the most expensive option but also the most direct way to get from the airport to Boulder (often $70 or higher one way). Public transportation to/from airport Transit from the Denver airport to Boulder is quite easy via the AB1 Boulder/Denver airport bus. This bus runs at least once an hour during the day, with more frequent trips at popular times. To locate the bus, follow signs in the Denver airport baggage claim area to \u2018Train to city,\u2019 which will lead you down an escalator. At the base of the escalator, instead of continuing straight towards the visible train station, turn left and you should see a bus terminal with an RTD ticket machine. Tickets for the AB1 can be purchased for $10. Find the gate for the AB1 / Downtown Boulder line. Transportation around the Boulder area \u00b6 Boulder has a number of public transportation options for traversing Boulder and the surrounding area. Bus lines Information about Boulder\u2019s local bus network can be found here . Note that the Skip, Bound, and Hop lines pass campus regularly. If you need to travel to Denver for any reason, the Flatiron Flyer bus connects Denver to Boulder. Currently the FF1 is the best option, and connects Denver\u2019s Union Station to the Downtown Boulder Station (with numerous stops in-between). Biking & Walking Boulder has an extensive system of city walking/biking paths; maps can be found here . Boulder B-Cycle is a community non-profit bike sharing system with daily and month passes available.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#hyr-sense-hyperspectral-and-thermal-remote-sensing-for-environmental-justice","text":"NASA-SBG and NSF-ESIIL \"HYR-SENSE: Hyperspectral and Thermal Remote Sensing for Environmental Justice\" program.

The HYR-SENSE program will follow all aspects of the ESIIL Code of Conduct (below). All community members and collaborators are responsible for cultivating this culture, embodying our values, welcoming diverse perspectives and ways of knowing, creating safe inclusive spaces, and conducting ethical science as guided by FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles for scientific and Indigenous data management, governance, and stewardship. Our values \u00b6 ESIIL\u2019s vision is grounded in the conviction that innovation and breakthroughs in environmental data science will be precipitated by a diverse, collaborative, curious, and inclusive research community empowered by open data and infrastructure, cross-sector and community partnerships, team science, and engaged learning. As such, our core values center people through inclusion, kindness, respect, collaboration, and genuine relationships. They also center innovation, driven by collaborative, cross-sector science and synthesis, open, accessible data and tools, and fun, diverse teams. Finally, they center learning, propelled by curiosity and accessible, inclusive training, and education opportunities. When and how to use these guidelines \u00b6 These guidelines outline behavior expectations for ESIIL and NASA-ESIIL HYR-SENSE community members and collaborators. Your participation in the ESIIL network is contingent upon following these guidelines in all ESIIL activities, including, but not limited to, participating in meetings, webinars, hackathons, working groups, hosted or funded by ESIIL, as well as email lists and online forums such as GitHub, Slack, and Twitter. These guidelines have been adapted from those of the International Arctic Research Policy Committee, the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, The Carpentries, and others. We encourage other organizations to adapt these guidelines for use in their own meetings. Note: HYR-SENSE breakout groups are encouraged to discuss these guidelines and what they mean to them, and will have the opportunity to add to them to specifically support and empower their team. Collaborative and behavior commitments complement data use, management, authorship, and access plans that commit to CARE and FAIR principles. Behavior Agreements \u00b6 ESIIL community members and collaborators are expected to act professionally and respectfully in all activities, such that each person, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, level of experience, language fluency, political affiliation, veteran status, pregnancy, country of origin, and any other characteristic protected under state or federal law, feels safe and welcome in our activities and community. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. In order to garner the benefits of a diverse community and to reach the full potential of our mission and charge, ESIIL participants must be allowed to develop a sense of belonging and trust within a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative culture. Guiding behaviors that contribute to this culture include, but are not limited to: Showing Respect \u00b6 Listen carefully \u2013 we each bring our own styles of communication, language, and ideas, and we must do our best to accept and accommodate differences. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking and maintain an open mind when others have different ideas than yours. Be present \u2013 when engaging with others, give them your full attention. If you need to respond to outside needs, please step away from the group quietly. Be kind \u2013 offer positive, supportive comments and constructive feedback. Critique ideas, not people. Harassment, discrimination, bullying, aggression, including offensive comments, jokes, and imagery, are unacceptable, regardless of intent, and will not be tolerated. Be punctual - adhere to the schedule provided by the organizers and avoid disruptive behavior during presentations, trainings, or working sessions. Respect privacy - be mindful of the confidentiality of others. Always obtain explicit consent before recording, sharing, or using someone else\u2019s personal information, photos, or recordings. Practice good digital etiquette (netiquette) when communicating online, whether in emails, messages, or social media - think before posting online and consider the potential impact on others. Do not share or distribute content generated by or involving others without their explicit consent. Being Inclusive \u00b6 Create space for everyone to participate \u2013 be thoughtful about who is at the table; openly address accessibility needs, and provide multiple ways to contribute. Be welcoming \u2013 ESIIL participants come from a wide range of skill levels and career stages, backgrounds, and cultures. Demonstrate that you value these different perspectives and identities through your words and actions, including through correct use of names, titles, and pronouns. Be self-aware \u2013 recognize that positionality, identity, unconscious biases, and upbringing can all affect how words and behaviors are perceived. Ensure that your words and behavior make others feel welcome. Commit to ongoing learning \u2013 the move toward inclusive, equitable, and just environmental data science is a collective journey. Continue to learn about and apply practices of inclusion, anti-racism, bystander intervention, and cultural sensitivity. None of us is perfect; all of us will, from time to time, fail to live up to our own high standards. Being perfect is not what matters; owning our mistakes and committing to clear and persistent efforts to grow and improve is. Being Curious \u00b6 Check your presumptions \u2013 we each bring our own ideas and assumptions about how the world should and does work \u2013 what are yours, and how do they affect how you interact with others? How do they shape your perception of new ideas? Ask questions \u2013 one of the strengths of interdisciplinary and diverse teams is that we all bring different knowledge and viewpoints; no one person is expected to know everything. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask, to learn, and to share. Be bold \u2013 significant innovations don\u2019t come from incremental efforts. Be brave in proposing and testing new ideas. When things don\u2019t work, learn from the experience. Invite feedback \u2013 new ideas and improvements can emerge from many places when we\u2019re open to hearing them. Check your defensiveness and listen; accept feedback as a gift toward improving our work and ourselves. Being Collaborative \u00b6 Recognize that everyone is bringing something different to the table \u2013 take the time to get to know each other. Keep an open mind, encourage ideas that are different from yours, and learn from each other\u2019s expertise and experience. Be accountable - great team science depends on trust, communication, respect, and delivering on your commitments. Be clear about your needs, as both a requester and a responder, realistic about your time and capacity commitments, and communicate timelines and standards in advance. Make assumptions explicit and provide context wherever possible - misunderstandings are common on transdisciplinary and cross-cultural teams and can best be managed with intentionality. Check in about assumptions, and be willing to share and correct misunderstandings or mistakes when they happen. Make use of collaboration agreements, communicate clearly and avoid jargon wherever possible. Respect intellectual property and Indigenous data sovereignty \u2013 ESIIL recognizes the extractive and abusive history of scientific engagement with Native peoples, and is committed to doing better. Indigenous knowledge holders are under no obligation to share their data, stories or knowledge. Their work should always be credited, and only shared with permission. Follow guidelines for authorship, Indigenous data sovereignty, and CARE principles. Acknowledge and credit the ideas and work of others. Use the resources that we provide - take advantage of the cyberinfrastructure and data cube at your disposal, but do not use them for unrelated tasks, as it could disrupt the event, introduce security risks, undermine the spirit of collaboration and fair play, and erode trust within the event community. Be safe - never share sensitive personal information; use strong passwords for your Cyverse and GitHub accounts and do not share them with other participants; be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or links; and verify online contacts. If you encounter any illegal or harmful activities online related to this event, report them to Tyler McIntosh or Susan Sullivan. Finally, speak up if you experience or notice a dangerous situation, or someone in distress! Code of Conduct: Unacceptable behaviors \u00b6 We adopt the full Code of Conduct of our home institution, the University of Colorado, details of which are found here . To summarize, examples of unacceptable and reportable behaviors include, but are not limited to: Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form Physical or verbal abuse by anyone to anyone, including but not limited to a participant, member of the public, guest, member of any institution or sponsor Unwelcome sexual attention or advances Personal attacks directed at other guests, members, participants, etc. Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations Threatening or stalking anyone Unauthorized use or sharing of personal or confidential information or private communication Continuing interactions, including but not limited to conversations, photographies, recordings, instant messages, and emails, after being asked to stop Ethical and scientific misconduct, including failing to credit contributions or respect intellectual property Engaging in any illegal activities, including hacking, cheating, or unauthorized access to systems or data Using the cyberinfrastructure provided by the organizers for activities unrelated to this event. Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. The University of Colorado recognizes all Federal and State protected classes, which include the following: race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, marital status, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Mistreatment or harassment not related to protected class also has a negative impact and will be addressed by the ESIIL team. Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If there is a clear violation of the code of conduct during an ESIIL event\u2014for example, a meeting is Zoom bombed or a team member is verbally abusing another participant during a workshop\u2014 ESIIL leaders, facilitators (or their designee) or campus/local police may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including expelling the violator, or immediate removal of the violator from any online or in-person event or platform without warning or refund. If such actions are necessary, there will be follow up with the ESIIL Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team to determine what further action is needed (see Reporting Process and Consequences below). Addressing Behavior Directly \u00b6 For smaller incidents that might be settled with a brief conversation, you may choose to contact the person in question or set up a (video) conversation to discuss how the behavior affected you. Please use this approach only if you feel comfortable; you do not have to carry the weight of addressing these issues yourself. If you are interested in this option but unsure how to go about it, please contact the ESIIL DEI lead, Susan Sullivan, first\u2014she will have advice on how to make the conversation happen and is available to join you in a conversation as requested. Reporting Process and Consequences \u00b6 We take any reports of Code of Conduct violations seriously, and aim to support those who are impacted and ensure that problematic behavior doesn\u2019t happen again. Making a Report \u00b6 If you believe you\u2019re experiencing or have experienced unacceptable behavior that is counter to this code of conduct, or you are witness to this behavior happening to someone else, we encourage you to contact the HYR-SENSE PI our the ESIIL DEI lead: Cibele Amaral, CIRES Email: cibele.amaral@colorado.edu Susan Sullivan, CIRES Email: susan.sullivan@colorado.edu You may also choose to anonymously report behavior to ESIIL using this form . The DEI team will keep reports as confidential as possible. However, as mandatory reporters, we have an obligation to report alleged protected class violations to our home institution or to law enforcement. Specifically: \u00b6 Cases of potential protected-class harassment will be reported to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance. If the violation is made by a member of another institution, that information may also be shared with that member\u2019s home institution by the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance under Title IX. In some instances, harassment information may be shared with the National Science Foundation, who are the funding organization of ESIIL. When we discuss incidents with people who are accused of misconduct (the respondent), we will anonymize details as much as possible to protect the privacy of the reporter and the person who was impacted (the complainant). In some cases, even when the details are anonymized, the respondent may guess at the identities of the reporter and complainants. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please let us know (or note that in your report). We encourage you to report in any case, so that we can support you while keeping ESIIL and NASA team members safe. In some cases, we are able to compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action based on that pattern. If you prefer to speak with someone who is not on the ESIIL leadership team, or who can maintain confidentiality, you may contact: CU Ombuds Phone: 303-492-5077 (for guidance and support navigating difficult conversations) CU Office of Victim Assistance Phone: 303-492-8855 If you want more information about when to report, or how to help someone who needs to report, please review the resources at Don\u2019t Ignore It . Note: The reporting party does not need to be directly involved in a code of conduct violation incident. Please make a bystander report if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you. What Happens After a Report Is Filed \u00b6 After a member of the ESIIL DEI team takes your report, they will (if necessary) consult with the appropriate support people at CU. The ESIIL DEI team will respond with a status update within 5 business days. During this time, they, or members of the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance, will: Meet with you or review report documentation to determine what happened Consult the documentation of past incidents for patterns of behavior Discuss appropriate response(s) to the incident Connect with the appropriate offices and/or make those response(s) Determine the follow-up actions for any impacted people and/or the reporter Follow up with the impacted people, including connecting them with support and resources. As a result of this process, in minor cases ESIIL DEI may communicate with the respondent to: \u00b6 Explain what happened and the impact of their behavior Offer concrete examples of how to improve their behavior Explain consequences of their behavior, or future consequences if the behavior is repeated. For significant infractions, follow up to the report may be turned over to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance and/or campus police. Possible Consequences to Code of Conduct Violations \u00b6 What follows are examples of possible responses to an incident report. This list is not inclusive, and ESIIL reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary. Generally speaking, the strongest response ESIIL may take is to completely ban a user from further engagement with ESIIL activities and, as is required, report a person to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance and/or their home institution and NSF. If law enforcement should be involved, they will recommend that the complainant make that contact. Employees of CU Boulder may also be subject to consequences as determined by the institution. In addition to the responses above, ESIIL responses may include but are not limited to the following: A verbal discussion in person or via phone/Zoom followed by documentation of the conversation via email Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the code of conduct Not allowing a speaker who violated the code of conduct to give (further) talks Immediately ending any HYR-SENSE team leadership, membership, or other responsibilities and privileges that a person holds Temporarily banning a person from HYR-SENSE and ESIIL activities Permanently banning a person from HYR-SENSE and ESIIL activities Nothing, if the behavior is determined to not be a code of conduct violation Do you need more resources? \u00b6 Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact the ESIIL DEI lead, Susan Sullivan, if you have questions or concerns. The CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance is a resource for all of us in navigating this space. They also offer resource materials that can assist you in exploring various topics and skills here. If you have questions about what, when or how to report, or how to help someone else with concerns, Don\u2019t Ignore It.

If you feel we could do better, we welcome your feedback. Comments, suggestions and praise are also very welcome! Acknowledgment \u00b6 By participating in this event, you agree to abide by this code of conduct and understand the consequences of violating it.

Introduction (2 minutes) \u00b6 A. Brief overview of GitHub: \u00b6 GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration features using Git, a distributed version control system. It enables developers to work together on projects, track changes to code, and efficiently manage different versions of the project. GitHub is widely used in the software development industry and is an essential tool for collaborative projects and maintaining code quality. B. Introduce GitHub Desktop and JupyterHub GitHub widget: \u00b6 GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that simplifies working with Git and GitHub by providing a more visual and intuitive way to manage repositories, branches, commits, and other Git features. JupyterHub GitHub widget, on the other hand, is a built-in widget that integrates Git and GitHub functionality directly into Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to perform version control and collaboration tasks within the Jupyter environment. Both tools help streamline the process of working with GitHub and make it more accessible to users with varying levels of experience with Git and version control. 1. Download GitHub Desktop \u00b6 Step 1: Download GitHub Desktop \u00b6 Go to the GitHub Desktop download page: https://desktop.github.com/ Click on the \u201cDownload for Windows\u201d or \u201cDownload for macOS\u201d button, depending on your operating system.

Open the \u201cApplications\u201d folder and double-click on \u201cGitHub Desktop\u201d to launch the application. Step 3: Set up GitHub Desktop \u00b6 When GitHub Desktop launches for the first time, you will be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account. If you don\u2019t have one, you can create one at https://github.com/join . Enter your GitHub username (or email) and password, and click on \u201cSign in.\u201d You will then be prompted to configure Git. Enter your name and email address, which will be used for your commit messages. Click \u201cContinue\u201d when you\u2019re done. Choose whether you want to submit usage data to help improve GitHub Desktop. Click \u201cFinish\u201d to complete the setup. Now, you have successfully installed and set up GitHub Desktop. You can start using it to clone repositories, make changes, commit, and sync with the remote repositories on GitHub. 1. Download GitHub for JupyterHub cloud service \u00b6 Step 1: Accessing JupyterHub on the cloud \u00b6 Visit the JupyterHub cloud service you want to use (e.g., Binder, Google Colab, or a custom JupyterHub deployment provided by your organization). Sign in with your credentials or authenticate using a third-party service if required. Step 2: Launch a new Jupyter Notebook or open an existing one \u00b6 Click on the \u201cNew\u201d button (usually located in the top right corner) and select \u201cPython\u201d to create a new Jupyter Notebook or open an existing one from the file browser. Once the notebook is open, you will see the Jupyter Notebook interface with the familiar cells for writing and executing code. Step 3: Install and enable the JupyterLab Git extension \u00b6 In your Jupyter Notebook, create a new code cell and run the following command to install the JupyterLab Git extension: !pip install jupyterlab-git Restart the Jupyter Notebook server for the changes to take effect. Step 4: Using the JupyterHub GitHub widget \u00b6 In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you should now see a Git icon on the left sidebar. Click on it to open the GitHub widget. To clone a repository, click on the \u201c+\u201d icon in the GitHub widget and enter the repository URL. This will clone the repository into your JupyterHub workspace. You can now navigate through the cloned repository, make changes, and use the GitHub widget to stage, commit, and push your changes back to the remote repository. To create and manage branches, use the branch icon in the GitHub widget. You can create new branches, switch between branches, and merge branches using this interface. To sync your local repository with the remote repository, use the \u201cPull\u201d and \u201cPush\u201d buttons in the GitHub widget. Now, you know how to access and use the JupyterHub GitHub widget running on the cloud. This allows you to work with Git and GitHub directly from your Jupyter Notebook interface, streamlining your workflow and making collaboration easier. C. GitHub in Rstudio: \u00b6 Integrating GitHub with RStudio allows users to manage their Git repositories and collaborate on projects directly within the RStudio environment. It offers similar functionality to GitHub Desktop but caters specifically to R users working within RStudio. By configuring RStudio to work with Git, creating or opening RStudio projects, and linking projects to GitHub repositories, users can enjoy a seamless workflow for version control and collaboration. RStudio\u2019s Git pane enables users to stage, commit, and push changes to remote repositories, as well as manage branches and sync local repositories with remote ones, providing a comprehensive solution for R developers working with GitHub. Step 1: Install Git \u00b6 Before integrating GitHub with RStudio, you need to have Git installed on your computer. Visit the official Git website ( https://git-scm.com/ ) to download and install the latest version of Git for your operating system. Step 2: Configure RStudio to work with Git \u00b6 Open RStudio. Go to \u201cTools\u201d > \u201cGlobal Options\u201d in the top menu. In the \u201cGlobal Options\u201d window, click on the \u201cGit/SVN\u201d tab. Check that the \u201cGit executable\u201d field is pointing to the correct location of the installed Git. If not, click \u201cBrowse\u201d and navigate to the location of the Git executable file (usually found in the \u201cbin\u201d folder of the Git installation directory). Click \u201cOK\u201d to save the changes. Step 3: Create or open an RStudio project \u00b6 To create a new RStudio project, go to \u201cFile\u201d > \u201cNew Project\u201d in the top menu. You can either create a new directory or choose an existing one for your project. To open an existing RStudio project, go to \u201cFile\u201d > \u201cOpen Project\u201d and navigate to the project\u2019s \u201c.Rproj\u201d file. Step 4: Link your RStudio project to a GitHub repository \u00b6 In the RStudio project, go to the \u201cTools\u201d menu and select \u201cVersion Control\u201d > \u201cProject Setup.\u201d In the \u201cProject Setup\u201d window, select \u201cGit\u201d as the version control system and click \u201cOK.\u201d A new \u201c.git\u201d folder will be created in your project directory, initializing it as a Git repository. Commit any changes you have made so far by clicking on the \u201cCommit\u201d button in the \u201cGit\u201d pane in RStudio. To link your local repository to a remote GitHub repository, go to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Copy the remote repository\u2019s URL (e.g., \u201c https://github.com/username/repository.git \u201d). In RStudio, open the \u201cShell\u201d by going to \u201cTools\u201d > \u201cShell.\u201d In the shell, run the following command to add the remote repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git Replace the URL with the one you copied from your GitHub repository. Push your changes to the remote repository by running the following command in the shell: git push -u origin master Now, your RStudio project is linked to a GitHub repository. You can use the \u201cGit\u201d pane in RStudio to stage, commit, and push changes to the remote repository, as well as manage branches and sync your local repository with the remote one. By integrating GitHub with RStudio, you can streamline your workflow, collaborate more effectively with your team, and manage your Git repositories directly from the RStudio interface. II. GitHub Basics (4 minutes) \u00b6 A. Repository: \u00b6 A repository, often abbreviated as \u201crepo,\u201d is the fundamental building block of GitHub. It is a storage space for your project files, including the code, documentation, and other related resources. Each repository also contains the complete history of all changes made to the project files, which is crucial for effective version control. Repositories can be public, allowing anyone to access and contribute, or private, restricting access to specific collaborators. B. Fork and Clone: \u00b6 Forking and cloning are two essential operations for working with repositories on GitHub. Forking creates a personal copy of someone else\u2019s repository under your GitHub account, enabling you to make changes to the project without affecting the original repo. Cloning, on the other hand, is the process of downloading a remote repository to your local machine for offline development. In GitHub Desktop, you can clone a repository by selecting \u201cClone a repository from the Internet\u201d and entering the repository URL. In JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can clone a repository by entering the repo URL in the \u201cClone Repository\u201d section of the widget. C. Branches: \u00b6 Branches are a critical aspect of Git version control, as they allow you to create multiple parallel versions of your project within a single repository. This is particularly useful when working on new features or bug fixes, as it prevents changes from interfering with the main (or \u201cmaster\u201d) branch until they are ready to be merged. Creating a new branch in GitHub Desktop can be done by clicking the \u201cCurrent Branch\u201d dropdown and selecting \u201cNew Branch.\u201d In JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can create a new branch by clicking the \u201cNew Branch\u201d button in the \u201cBranches\u201d section of the widget. D. Replace \u2018master\u2019 with \u2018main\u2019: \u00b6 In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of inclusive language in technology. One such example is the use of the term \u201cmaster\u201d in the context of the default branch in a GitHub repository. The term \u201cmaster\u201d has historical connections to the \u201cmaster/slave\u201d file structure, which evokes an unsavory colonial past associated with slavery. In light of this, many developers and organizations have begun to replace the term \u201cmaster\u201d with more neutral terms, such as \u201cmain.\u201d We encourage you to follow this practice and change the default branch name in your repositories from \u201cmaster\u201d to \u201cmain\u201d or another suitable alternative. This small change can help promote a more inclusive and welcoming environment within the technology community. III. Collaboration and Version Control (5 minutes) \u00b6 A. Commits: \u00b6 Commits are snapshots of your project\u2019s changes at a specific point in time, serving as the fundamental building blocks of Git\u2019s version control system. Commits make it possible to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others. In GitHub Desktop, you can make a commit by staging the changes you want to include, adding a descriptive commit message, and clicking \u201cCommit to [branch_name].\u201d In JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can create a commit by selecting the files with changes, entering a commit message, and clicking the \u201cCommit\u201d button. B. Push: \u00b6 In GitHub, \u201cpush\u201d is a fundamental operation in the version control process that transfers commits from your local repository to a remote repository, such as the one hosted on GitHub. When you push changes, you synchronize the remote repository with the latest updates made to your local repository, making those changes accessible to other collaborators working on the same project. This operation ensures that the remote repository reflects the most recent state of your work and allows your team members to stay up to date with your changes. Pushing is an essential step in distributed version control systems like Git, as it promotes efficient collaboration among multiple contributors and provides a centralized location for tracking the project\u2019s history and progress. In GitHub, the concepts of \u201ccommit\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d represent two distinct steps in the version control process. A \u201ccommit\u201d is the action of saving changes to your local repository. When you commit changes, you create a snapshot of your work, accompanied by a unique identifier and an optional descriptive message. Commits allow you to track the progress of your work over time and make it easy to revert to a previous state if necessary. On the other hand, \u201cpush\u201d is the action of transferring your local commits to a remote repository, such as the one hosted on GitHub. Pushing makes your changes accessible to others collaborating on the same project and ensures that the remote repository stays up to date with your local repository. In summary, committing saves changes locally, while pushing synchronizes those changes with a remote repository, allowing for seamless collaboration among multiple contributors. C. Pull Requests: \u00b6 Pull requests are a collaboration feature on GitHub that enables developers to propose changes to a repository, discuss those changes, and ultimately merge them into the main branch. To create a pull request, you must first push your changes to a branch on your fork of the repository. Then, using either GitHub Desktop or JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can navigate to the original repository, click the \u201cPull Request\u201d tab, and create a new pull request. After the pull request is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch. D. Merging and Resolving Conflicts: \u00b6 Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when a feature or bugfix has been completed and is ready to be integrated into the main branch. Conflicts can arise during the merging process if the same lines of code have been modified in both branches. To resolve conflicts, you must manually review the changes and decide which version to keep. In GitHub Desktop, you can merge branches by selecting the target branch and choosing \u201cMerge into Current Branch.\u201d Conflicts will be highlighted, and you can edit the files to resolve them before committing the changes.

Issues and Project Management: \u00b6 Issues are a powerful feature in GitHub that allows developers to track and manage bugs, enhancements, and other tasks within a project. Issues can be assigned to collaborators, labeled for easy organization, and linked to specific commits or pull requests. They provide a centralized location for discussing and addressing project-related concerns, fostering collaboration and transparent communication among team members. Using issues effectively can significantly improve the overall management and organization of your projects. B. GitHub Pages: \u00b6 GitHub Pages is a service offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a repository. By creating a new branch named \u201cgh-pages\u201d in your repository and adding the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), GitHub will automatically build and deploy your website to a publicly accessible URL. This is particularly useful for showcasing project documentation, creating personal portfolios, or hosting project demos. With GitHub Pages, you can take advantage of the version control and collaboration features of GitHub while easily sharing your work with others. V. Conclusion (2 minutes) \u00b6 A.

Applications of hyperspectral data include plant species identification, invasive species management, assessment of phytoplankton functional types, mapping of wetlands and shallow benthic communities, and detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The ability of hyperspectral data to characterize chemical, physiological, and morphological traits allows decision-makers to better understand critical components of ecosystem dynamics such as invasive species encroachment, forest decline and pest infestation, and ocean dynamics. This training is also an opportunity to build capacity in a large user community prior to the launch of the highly anticipated global hyperspectral SBG mission.

Math Notation \u00b6 Markdown can be combined with LaTeX for mathematical notation, useful in environmental data science for expressing statistical distributions, coordinate systems, and more. This requires a Markdown renderer with LaTeX support (like MathJax or KaTeX). Inline Math : Use single dollar signs for inline math expressions. Representing the normal distribution. Example: The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by \\(f(x|\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\\) .` Display Math : Use double dollar signs for standalone equations. Example: $$ f(x|\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e {-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) 2} $$ Common LaTeX Elements for Environmental Data Science : Statistical Distributions : Normal Distribution: \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} for \\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\\) Poisson Distribution: P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} for \\(P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\) Coordinate Systems : Spherical Coordinates: (r, \\theta, \\phi) for \\((r, \\theta, \\phi)\\) Cartesian Coordinates: (x, y, z) for \\((x, y, z)\\) Geospatial Equations : Haversine Formula for Distance: a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1)\\cos(\\phi_2)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\\right) for \\(a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1)\\cos(\\phi_2)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\\right)\\) Note: The rendering of these equations as formatted math will depend on your Markdown viewer's LaTeX capabilities. 7.
